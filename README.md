# typeberry ü´ê

Typeberry is a TypeScript implementation of [JAM protocol](https://graypaper.com/).

# Implementation status

- [ ] PVM (ongoing)
- [ ] State Trie (ongoing)
- [ ] Safrole (ongoing)
- [ ] Block Import
- [ ] GRANDPA
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Data Availability

# Requirements 

```
$ node --version
v 22.1.0
```

We recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage different `node` versions.

## Installing dependencies

```
$ npm i
```

## Running unit tests

```
$ npm run test
```

## Running formatting & linting

```
$ npm run ci
```

Formatting & linting is done by [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/)). You can run separate tools using commands below.
Note that all safe fixes will be applied automatically.

```
$ npm run format # format the code
$ npm run lint   # lint the code
$ npm run check  # organize imports
```

A shorthand to run all the checks and apply safe fixes all at once is:
```
$ npm run ci-fix
```

## Running JSON tests

To run JSON test cases coming from the official [JAM test vectors repository](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/) you need to first
check out the repository with test cases and then use `test-runner` to execute them.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors.git
$ cd typeberry
$ npm run ts-node ./bin/test-runner.ts ../jamtestvectors/**/*.json
```

Obviously it's also possible to run just single test case or part of the testcases by altering the glob pattern in the path.
