Typeberry is a TypeScript implementation of [JAM protocol](https://graypaper.com/).

## Implementation status

- [x] PVM
- [ ] State Trie (ongoing)
- [ ] Safrole (ongoing)
- [ ] Block Import
- [ ] GRANDPA
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Data Availability

## Requirements

```bash
$ node --version
v 22.1.0
```

We recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage different
`node` versions.

### Installing dependencies

```bash
$ npm ci
```

### Running typeberry

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Formatting & linting

```bash
$ npm run qa
```

Formatting & linting is done by [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/)). You can run
separate tools using commands below.
Note that all safe fixes will be applied automatically.

```bash
$ npm run format # format the code
$ npm run lint   # lint the code & organise imports
```

A shorthand to run all the checks and apply safe fixes all at once is:
```bash
$ npm run qa-fix
```

### Running unit tests

```bash
$ npm run test
```

Running tests from a single package:
```bash
$ npm run test -w @typeberry/trie
```

### Running benchmarks
This command will run all benchmarks from `./benchmarks/` folder

```bash
$ npm start -w @typeberry/benchmark
```

Since each benchmark file is also runnable, it's easy to run just one benchmark, e.g:
```bash
$ npm exec ts-node ./benchmarks/math/mul_overflow.ts
```

### Running JSON test vectors

To run JSON test cases coming from the official
[JAM test vectors repository](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/) you need
to first check out the repository with test cases and then use `test-runner`
to execute them.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors.git
$ npm start -w @typeberry/test-runner  --  jamtestvectors/**/*.json ../jamtestvectors/erasure_coding/vectors/*
```

Obviously it's also possible to run just single test case or part of the test
cases by altering the glob pattern in the path.

### Adding a new component / package

```bash
$ npm init -w ./packages/mycomponent
```

This command will automatically update the `workspaces` field in top-level `package.json`.

## Codestyle

A brief, but evolving description of our codestyle and guideliness is availabe
in [CODESTYLE](./CODESTYLE.md).
