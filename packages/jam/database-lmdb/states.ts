/**
 * LMDB-backed state storage.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * 1. For each block we end up with some posterior state.
 * 2. Majority of state entries will stay the same, however there are some that always change.
 * 3. We rarely need `stateRoot`, only needed to verify that we importing a
 *    block on the correct state.
 * 4. We rarely need intermediate trie nodes, only needed for answering warp-sync (CE129)
 *    and producing state proofs.
 *
 * The trie for JAM is designed so that every node takes exactly 64 bytes. Values
 * that don't fit directly into a trie node (larger than 32bytes) are hash-referenced
 * there.
 * Thanks to this, we can estimate that for each and every state, all of the leaf nodes
 * "should not take a lot"â„¢. Let's assume that we have:
 * 1. 999 services
 * 2. Each service has 50 preimages, so also roughly 50 preimage lookups.
 * 3. On top of that we have 899 storage entries (arbitrary size)
 * 4. That gives us roughly 1000 trie leaves for each service (50 + 50 + 899 + 1(info))
 * 5. We have 15 always-present storage entries (let's round it up to 1k)
 *
 * Hence in total we should have 999 * 1000 + 15 ~ 1M leaves.
 * So for every state, all of the leaves should occupy roughly `64B * 1M = 64MB`.
 * Large values that do not change, are automatically deduplicated via hash-references.
 *
 * It seems very sensible then to:
 * 1. Just store trie leaves for each state.
 * 2. Prune old (finalized) states (otherwise 24h of states = 14400 blocks * 64MB ~ 1TB)
 * 3. Recompute the trie in-memory only if needed.
 *
 * Obviously from just the leaf nodes we can easily obtain the entire state.
 *
 * That's the approach we are implementing here (for now without pruning:)).
 *
 * Since when referencing some state we always think of it in terms of a posterior
 * state produced by some block, we use `HeaderHash` to index the leaf collections.
 *
 * The state root (if needed) can be easily recomputed by merkelizing the leaves.
 *
 * We might need to implement some reference counting for values, or at least
 * know the last state that is referencing them, so that they can be purged from
 * the `values` database when they are not needed any more.
 *
 * TODO [ToDr] To implement when actually needed:
 * - [ ] state pruning on finality / pre-defined window (warp threshold?)
 * - [ ] removing unused values
