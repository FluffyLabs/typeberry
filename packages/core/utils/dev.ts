 * The function will produce relative path resolver that is adjusted
 * for package location within the workspace.
 *
 * Example:
 * $ npm start -w @typeberry/jam
 *
 * The above command will run `./bin/jam/index.js`, however we would
 * still want relative paths to be resolved according to top-level workspace
 * directory.
 *
 * So the caller, passes the absolute workspace path as argument and get's
 * a function that can properly resolve relative paths.
 *
 * NOTE: the translation happens only for development build! When
 * we build a single library from our project, we no longer mangle the paths.
