## Avoid dependencies.

Any external dependencies need to be chosen carefuly to avoid supply chain attacks. It's better to re-write just what you need
than to bring in an entire package.

## Naming conventions:
1. `*.test.ts` - test files
2. `*.node.ts` - Node runtime specific files.
3. `*.web.ts` - Web Browser runtime specific files.

Files without a special convention must be compatible with both node and web environment (aka "core" files).

## Avoid allocations

While it's nearly impossible to avoid all allocations in TypeScript,
we might try to limit allocations of large objects
and re-use the memory as much as possible.

The goal is to avoid stop-the-world GC pauses.
